# github-actions-test

I've used this repository to test the VMs and features provided by GitHub Actions. I have divided each `test` into folders.
They also have their own `tag` chains (`tauri-v*`, `metadata-v*`, etc). Feel free to clone the repo and use it for your own tests.
If anything here is outdated or of the sort, go ahead and submit a PR.
